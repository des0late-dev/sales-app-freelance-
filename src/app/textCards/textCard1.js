          The gut-punch of watching your bet lose by a nose while the bookies
          nick another chunk out of your money.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's walking into the pub later, mates buzzing, and you muttering,
          "Nah, didn't land today."
        </p>

        <p>
          It's the bloke who works at the bookie giving you a blank stare as
          though you're a mug who should have known better. But what does he
          know?!

        <p>We've all been there.</p>

        <p className="font-bold">Too many times.</p>

            Over 2,074 tips, we've pulled in Â£8,201 profit with just a 10.3%
            strike rate.

        </div>

        <p>That's not a typo.</p>

        <p>
          That's not some <strong>"winner every race"</strong> fairy tale.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's the reality of a system built to target what bookies fear most:
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold">
          Big-priced horses at the sweet spots the market overlooks.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
