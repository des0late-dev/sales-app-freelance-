Think back to your last month of betting.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#1E1E1E] leading-relaxed   ">
How many <strong>&apos;&apos;sure things&apos;&apos;</strong> bottled it?        
</p>
        <p className="text-[#1E1E1E] leading-relaxed ">
    
How many bets went in the bin before the race was even halfway?
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#1E1E1E] leading-relaxed ">

       <p className="text-[#1E1E1E] leading-relaxed ">
Like the bookies have already written the script, and you&apos;re just paying for the privilege of watching.
       </p>
        <p className="text-[#1E1E1E] leading-relaxed ">
And if you keep playing their game, they&apos;re right. &apos; keep losing.     
</p> 
 <p className="text-[#1E1E1E] leading-relaxed ">
<strong>But play our game?</strong>

Suddenly, the numbers flip.
