Think back to your last month of betting.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]    ">
How many <strong>{'“'}sure things{'”'} </strong> bottled it?        
</p>
        <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]  ">
    
How many bets went in the bin before the race was even halfway?
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]  ">
How many times did you fancy the price but then watched the odds crash just before the off, making your {'“'}value{'”'} disappear before your eyes?
</p>
      
         <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]  ">
<strong>That cycle is exhausting.</strong>
        </p>
        
         <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]   ">
It makes you feel like betting is a mug&apos;s game.
</p>
       
       <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]  ">
Like the bookies have already written the script, and you&apos;re just paying for the privilege of watching.
       </p>
        <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]  ">
And if you keep playing their game, they&apos;re right. You&apos;ll keep losing.     
</p> 
 <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]  ">
<strong>But play our game?</strong>

</p> 
 <p className="text-[#1E1E1E]  ">
Suddenly, <u>the numbers flip.</u>
